## How do I load the 'development environment'

1. Clone this repository. 
2. Next you will need to create the `.credentials` file - please speak to the repository contributors for details.
3. Open Rstudio and go to File > Open Project and select the file 'sidora.core.Rproj' in the repository. 
4. Press `Ctrl` + `shift` + `b` to build the package and load the library. (alternatively, in the top right pane go to the 'Build' tab and press Install and Restart)
4. Now you can start your own, or open the file `playground/test.R` to test out the core functions.
