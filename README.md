# sidora.core

Functions to access and download tables of the MPI-SHH DAG Pandora database. Serves as backend for all sidora applications. 

## Quickstart

Load the package and establish a database connection to Pandora.

```
library(magrittr)
library(sidora.core)

con <- DBI::dbConnect(
  RMariaDB::MariaDB(), 
  host = "host", user = "user", password = "password", db = "pandora"
)
```

You can access individual tables either by establishing a DBI connection (`get_con()`) to them or by downloading them as a data.frame (`get_df()`). `get_df()` does two additional things: It transforms the columns of the downloaded table to the correct data type (with `enforce_types()`) and it caches the downloaded table locally. The default is a per-R-session cache, but you can cache more permanently by changing the `cache_dir` and `cache_max_age` parameters.

```
# get DBI connection
get_con("TAB_Site", con)
# get a local data.frame 
get_df("TAB_Site", con)
```

You can download multiple tables at once with `get_con_list()` and `get_df_list()`, which return a named list of objects. The latter again includes the additional type transformation and caching feature.

```
# get list of DBI connections
get_con_list(c(
  "TAB_Site", "TAB_Individual", "TAB_Sample", "TAB_Extract", "TAB_Library"
), con = con)
# get list of data.frames
df_list <- get_df_list(c(
  "TAB_Site", "TAB_Individual", "TAB_Sample", "TAB_Extract", "TAB_Library"
), con = con)
```

Some Pandora tables can be merged following a hierarchical, pair-wise logic of primary and foreign keys. `join_pandora_tables()` is a join function which is aware of this logic and automatically combines lists of data.frames with Pandora tables (as produced by `get_con_list()` or `get_df_list()`) to long data.frames.

```
jt <- join_pandora_tables(df_list)

get_df_list(c(
  "TAB_Site", "TAB_Individual"
), con = con) %>% join_pandora_tables()
```

## How do I load the 'development environment'

1. Clone this repository. 
2. Next you will need to create the `.credentials` file - please speak to the repository contributors for details.
3. Open Rstudio and go to File > Open Project and select the file 'sidora.core.Rproj' in the repository. 
4. Press `Ctrl` + `shift` + `b` to build the package and load the library. (alternatively, in the top right pane go to the 'Build' tab and press Install and Restart)
